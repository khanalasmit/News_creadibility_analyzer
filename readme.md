In recent years, social media has evolved from a platform for meeting and connectingwith friends to an environment where people create and exchange different types ofinformation [1]. Compared to traditional newspapers, content shared on social mediausually does not pass an editorial check [2], making it more susceptible to fake contentand information [3]. Spreading rumors and false stories is a typical human activity thathas existed since the beginning of mankind [4,5], but social media has ampliﬁed thisphenomenon by spreading fake information faster and more widely [6,7]. Most of thetime, every piece of information posted on social media reaches millions of users in realtime, which, in the case of misinformation, can be a problem for companies, organizations,and even individuals. Fake news shared on social media can damage the reputation ofcompanies or individuals [8], it can represent a ﬁnancial threat for companies or politicalcampaigns [9,10], or, in some cases, it can even lead to boycotts [11].
